# Student Database Management System

## Overview
This is a simple Student Database Management System built using Python's `tkinter` for the GUI and `pickle` for data serialization. The application allows users to add, view, save, and load student data (Roll No, Name, and Course) to/from a file.

## Features
- **Add Student:** Users can input and add student details (Roll No, Name, and Course).
- **View Students:** Displays a list of all added students.
- **Save Data:** Save the student data to a file (`students.dat`).
- **Load Data:** Load the student data from the saved file (`students.dat`).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation
